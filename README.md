# HCMUS - Applied Mathematics and Statistics Projects
We are from [fit@hcmus](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/vn/), and this repository stores our projects for the Applied Mathematics and Statistics (MTH00051) course.

## 1. Project 1
<h5 id="project-1"></h5>

### 1.1. Requirements
Requirements for project 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Applied-Maths-and-Statistics-Projects/blob/main/Project-1/Project_01_TUDTK.pdf).  

### 1.2. Details
This project has 2 problems. 
   
**Problem 1: Description of the precipitations data.**  
This problem uses line graph and scatter plot to visualize the data, then find the statistical parameters of the data (mean, mode, median, and standard deviation).  
Then, we used these parameters to describe the data.  
Project 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Applied-Maths-and-Statistics-Projects/tree/main/Project-1).
  
**Problem 2: Prediction of annual average temperature.**  
First, this problem uses line graph and scatter plot to visualize the data, in order to have an overview of the data distribution.  
Then, we build a regression model to predict the annual average temperature.  
Project 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Applied-Maths-and-Statistics-Projects/tree/main/Project-2).

## 2. Project 2
<h5 id="project-2"></h5>

### 2.1. Requirements
Requirements for project 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Applied-Maths-and-Statistics-Projects/blob/main/Project-2/Project_02_TUDTK.pdf).

### 2.2. Details
**Topic: Hidden Markov Model**  
This project includes our research on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).  
The project is divided into 3 parts:
<ul>
<li> 1. <a href="project-2-1"> Theory </a></li>
<li> 2. <a href="project-2-2"> Implementation </a></li>
<li> 3. <a href="project-2-1"> Application </a></li>
</ul>

#### 2.2.1. Theory
<h5 id="project-2-1"></h5>
This part provides the following content:
<ul>
<li>Components of a HMM.</li>
<li>Assumptions for a HMM.</li>
<li>Forward algorithm to compute likelihood of a sequence of observations.</li>
<li>Viterbi algorithm to determine the most probable sequence of states from a given sequence of observations.</li>
<li>Baum - Welch algorithm to learn the HMM parameters.</li>
</ul>

#### 2.2.2. Implementation
<h5 id="project-2-2"></h5>
This part provides the following content:
<ul>
<li>The implemetation of the algorithms in the Theory part.</li>
<li>The usage of these algorithms to solve a problem.</li>
</ul>

#### 2.2.3. Application
<h5 id="project-2-3"></h5>
This part provides an application of the HMM: POS tagging.  

Details of this part can be found at this <a href="https://github.com/vanloc1808/HCMUS-Applied-Maths-and-Statistics-Projects/blob/main/Project-2/03.%20Application/Application.ipynb">link</a>.
